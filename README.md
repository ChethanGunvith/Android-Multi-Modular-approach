# Using Navigation Component to Navigate Between Dynamic Feature Modules

Recently Iâ€™ve been working on a brand new application that is fairly complex and has over 30 different screens to start with. 
We decided that we are going to take advantage of the Dynamic Feature Modules and ended up having an architecture like this: 

The app module is the core module of the application. It serves as a starting point and contains some common classes used along with modules. 
Each new feature is a new dynamic module and acts like it's living in its own world without any knowledge of other features. 
They only know about the app module.


The benefit of using this approach is huge. For one, we have an architecture that will be so easy to scale because adding a new feature will not affect other parts 
of the code. Working in a team? Each team member can work on separate feature reducing the chances of something breaking in other places.

This project will help you to learn how the dynamic feature or any feature module are made . more importantly you learn the way of navigation between this module.
